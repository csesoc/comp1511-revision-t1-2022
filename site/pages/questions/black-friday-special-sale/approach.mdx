# Approach

_Written by [Westley Lo] from [CSESoc Competitions]_

We first want to store the prices of Bob and Sue's items so we can pick out items later.
Since we are given the number of items each have, we can use them to make two separate arrays.

The maximum number of items that can be picked is equal to:

```
minimum(Bob's number of items, Sue's number of items) * 2
```

Since the number of items we can pick is dependent on who has the fewer items in their array, that's our first priority,
**figure out which of the two array has fewer items, and how many items are in there.**

Once we figure out which is the smaller array and its size (We will call it `N`), we then want to make an integer variable `total_price` and sum up all the prices in the smaller array.

we then want to pick out the `N` most expensive items from longer array to maximise the total price of the haul.
We can do that by either:

1. Looping through the larger array `N` times, find the largest element, add it to `total_price`, and replace that element with -1.
2. Sort the whole array and pick out the `N` biggest items from there and add it to `total_price`
   Whichever is more comfortable.

Once we done that, we can just print `total_price` and we will be done!
